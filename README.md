* #### [Project Files](https://github.com/mj14991/Udacity_DeepLearningND/tree/master/Project%201%20-%20Bike%20Sharing)


Predicting Bike sharing rides from historical data with a neural network

### 2. Dog Breed Classifier with a CNN


* #### [Project Files](https://github.com/mj14991/Udacity_DeepLearningND/tree/master/Project%202%20-%20Dog%20Breed%20Classifier%20-%20Image%20Classifier)

Creating an image classifier with CNN. Given an image of a dog, the algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human, the code will identify the resembling dog breed. 


### 3. Dog Breed Classifier with a CNN
